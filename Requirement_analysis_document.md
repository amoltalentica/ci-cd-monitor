# Requirement Analysis Document

## ðŸ“Œ Project: CI/CD Monitor Dashboard

A system to monitor CI/CD pipelines, track health metrics, and provide real-time alerts.

---

## 1. Objective

The primary objective is to build a **CI/CD Pipeline Health Dashboard** that integrates with GitHub Actions and similar CI/CD tools to:
- Track success/failure rates, build times, and workflow status.
- Provide real-time monitoring and visualization.
- Trigger alerts on pipeline failures or degraded performance.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Data Collection**
   - Fetch pipeline execution data from GitHub Actions API.
   - Support additional CI/CD systems (future: Jenkins, GitLab CI).

2. **Data Storage**
   - Store pipeline execution data in a PostgreSQL database.
   - Maintain history of runs for analytics.

3. **Metrics & Visualization**
   - Success/failure rate tracking.
   - Build time distribution.
   - Real-time dashboard of pipeline health.

4. **Notifications**
   - Slack integration for alerts.
   - Extensible to other channels (Email, MS Teams).

5. **User Interface**
   - Web dashboard built with React + Tailwind.
   - Metrics visualization (graphs, trends, alerts).

6. **Deployment**
   - Containerized with Docker & Docker Compose.
   - Configurable via environment variables.

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Dashboard updates within 5s of new pipeline execution.
- **Scalability**: Extendable to multiple repositories and CI/CD providers.
- **Reliability**: Fault-tolerant database with persistent storage.
- **Security**: Use GitHub tokens securely via `.env` file; no secrets in codebase.

---

## 4. Assumptions

- GitHub token has `repo` and `workflow` permissions.
- Developers have Docker & Docker Compose installed.
- Slack Webhook URL is provided for notifications (optional).
- Single repository monitoring to start, multi-repo planned later.

---

## 5. Constraints

- Limited to GitHub Actions API rate limits.
- PostgreSQL required for historical data.
- Requires internet connectivity for API integration.

---

## 6. Tools & Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Integrations**: GitHub Actions API, Slack Webhooks
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose

---

## 7. Architecture Overview

- **Frontend** â†’ React UI
- **Backend** â†’ FastAPI service handling API requests & data processing
- **Database** â†’ PostgreSQL for metrics storage
- **Integrations** â†’ GitHub API + Slack for alerts
- **Orchestration** â†’ Docker Compose for local & cloud deployment

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: API rate limiting from GitHub.  
  **Mitigation**: Implement caching & scheduled data pulls.

- **Risk**: Pipeline data volume growth.  
  **Mitigation**: Optimize DB schema & introduce archiving.

- **Risk**: Slack webhook misuse.  
  **Mitigation**: Securely store tokens and allow rotation.

---

## 9. Future Enhancements

- Multi-repo and multi-CI/CD system support.
- Role-based access for dashboard users.
- Predictive analytics using ML for pipeline failure prediction.
- Extended integrations: Email, MS Teams, PagerDuty.

---

## âœ… Conclusion

The CI/CD Monitor Dashboard provides a robust foundation for monitoring GitHub Actions pipelines with real-time metrics and alerts. With modular design, it can be extended to other CI/CD tools, making it a scalable DevOps observability solution.
